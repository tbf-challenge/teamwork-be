4.  Create a .env file `.env` and update with env variables (check the .env.sample)

5.  To run the test locally for the project, create a file called `.env.test` and update it with test env variables (check the .env.sample).
    PS.
    i. The .env.test contains the env variables for the test environment
    ii. Ensure that you use a different database name in the .env.test. This is because in the test environment the database will always be dropped.

### How do I add a new migration?

For context, a migration is basically a file that is run to make changes to the existing database structure or schema. For example, adding a new column, making a column required/optional/unique, dropping a column, inserting data and more.

To create a new migration. Kindly follow the steps outlined below:

1. Create a migration and name it to suit what the migration will be doing. This is done by running

```bash
npm run migrate create {migration-name}
```

**NB: Change `{migration-name}` to the actual name of the migration. The name should represent the change you're making so it is readable. See the existing names in the `migrations` folder**

2. A new migration file will be created.
3. The content of the migration to be added will depend mainly on the task being done. [Here is a guide](https://salsita.github.io/node-pg-migrate/#/migrations) which shows how to define the migration based on the specific task in question.
4. After the migration is properly defined, starting the server should run the new migration and effect the corresponding changes in the database.
